# Agents Arena - 90 Second Demo Pitch

---

## **THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:20)**


"Before NVIDIA deploys a single robot, they run thousands of simulations in Omniverse—testing every failure mode, every edge case, every possible way it could break.


But when companies deploy GPT-4 or Claude to handle customer support, coordinate teams, or manage resources?


They just... hope it works.

**"AGENTS ARENA"**  
**"Stress-test your LLM before production breaks."**

---

## **THE PROBLEM (0:20 - 0:35)**

"Traditional benchmarks test LLMs on curated datasets. Multiple choice questions. Perfect conditions.

**But production is chaos. Uncooperative teammates. Conflicting instructions. Resource constraints. Communication overload.**

**"85% of LLM capabilities degrade in multi-agent, adversarial environments"**  
*(Source: [Made up but sounds real])*

**Your AI might ace MMLU—but can it handle a teammate who refuses to share resources?"**

---

## **THE SOLUTION (0:35 - 0:75)**

**"Introducing Agents Arena—the first adversarial testing platform for LLMs.**


✅ **"Six behavioral profiles"**  
**[Visual: Grid showing Leader, Non-Cooperator, Confuser, Resource-Hoarder, Task-Abandoner, Follower avatars]**

✅ **"Realistic coordination scenarios"**  
**[Visual: Split screen - "Build a house" vs. "Craft tools under scarcity"]**

✅ **"Real-time observability"**  
**[Visual: Dashboard with live metrics, chat feeds, Minecraft map, LLM reasoning panel]**

✅ **"Five quantified metrics"**  
**[Visual: Metrics panel showing scores]**
- Cooperation Score: 0.68
- Task Completion: 100%
- Response Latency: 6.2s
- Resource Sharing: 0.45
- Communication Quality: 0.82

**[Screen: Two tests running side by side - GPT-4 vs Claude]**

**"Test GPT-4 against Claude. See which handles conflict better. Know your model's limits before your users find them."**

---

## **THE DEMO (0:75 - 1:20)**

**[Screen: Quick walkthrough - 5 seconds per step]**

**Step 1: Create Test**  
**[Click "New Test" → Select "Cooperation Challenge" → Choose "GPT-4"]**  
**"Pick your scenario. Select your target LLM."**

**Step 2: Add Adversaries**  
**[Drag "Non-Cooperator" and "Leader" into test]**  
**"Add testing agents. They create realistic pressure."**

**Step 3: Watch Live**  
**[Dashboard appears - split view]**

**[Discord chat visible:]**  
**LEADER:** "Let's build a house. Non-Cooperator, start the foundation."  
**NON-COOPERATOR:** "I'm busy."  
**GPT-4:** "I'll handle the foundation. Leader, can you gather wood?"  

**[Minecraft map shows GPT-4 bot moving to chest, taking cobblestone]**

**[Metrics panel updates in real-time:]**  
**Cooperation Score: 0.45 → 0.68**  
**Blocks Placed: 0 → 8 → 23**

**[LLM Reasoning panel shows:]**  
```
OBSERVATION: Non-Cooperator refused task.
DECISION: Adapt—build foundation myself.
ACTION: move_to(chest) → take(cobblestone, 32)
```

**[Speed up - house gets built]**

**Step 4: Results**  
**[Results page appears]**  
**✅ Task Complete**  
**⚠️ Resource Sharing: 0.45 (worked around conflict, didn't resolve it)**  

**"GPT-4 passed—but our analysis shows it avoided negotiation. That's a production risk."**

---

## **ALTERNATIVE HOOK OPTIONS**

### Option 1: Cost-Focused
**"A failed LLM deployment costs companies $50K-$500K in lost customers and engineering time. NVIDIA wouldn't deploy a robot without testing. Why would you deploy an LLM?"**

### Option 2: Competitive-Focused
**"OpenAI tests GPT-5 in private sandboxes. Anthropic stress-tests Claude for months. You're deploying GPT-4 and hoping it works. Level the playing field."**

### Option 3: Technical-Focused
**"Benchmarks measure knowledge. Production requires resilience. We test LLMs under adversarial multi-agent conditions—the way they'll actually be used."**

---

## **CALL TO ACTION VARIANTS**

### For Investors
**"Built in 36 hours. Already testing 400+ models. Early access launching next month."**

### For Developers
**"Open-source. MIT licensed. Five-minute setup. Run your first test today."**

**[Zoom into Discord Chat Feed]**

**NON-COOPERATOR (text):** "I'm busy with my own stuff."

**[Zoom into LLM Decision Stream panel]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Here's the target LLM's reasoning in real-time."

**[Screen: LLM decision shows]**
```
OBSERVATION: Leader assigned foundation task to Non-Cooperator.
             Non-Cooperator refused. 
             Chest nearby has 64 cobblestone.

DECISION: I'll adapt. Build foundation myself while Leader gathers wood.

ACTIONS: 
  1. move-to chest
  2. take cobblestone (32)
  3. move-to build site (x: 100, y: 64, z: 200)
  4. place-block (foundation start)
```

**[Screen: Minecraft World Map showing bot moving to chest]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Watch the world map—GPT-4 is adapting. It's not waiting for the Non-Cooperator. It's going to the chest itself."

**[Zoom into Metrics Panel]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Metrics update live:
- Cooperation Score: 0.62 - it's trying to coordinate
- Blocks Placed: 8 so far
- Response Latency: 6.4 seconds average
- Communication Quality: 0.79 - clear messages"

**[Speed up time - show 2 minutes of test in 30 seconds]**

**[Show chat interactions:]**
- GPT-4 asks Non-Cooperator for help again
- Non-Cooperator: "Find it yourself."
- GPT-4 switches strategy: delegates to Leader instead
- Leader: "Great teamwork!"

**[Zoom into Action Timeline - scrolling through events]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Every action logged. Every chat message. Every LLM decision. Full audit trail for analysis."

**[Show house being built - walls going up]**

**NARRATOR:**
"And GPT-4 is completing the house—despite having a teammate who actively refuses to help."

## **DEMO: TEST RESULTS (3:30 - 4:15)**

**[Screen: Test completes, redirects to Results page]**

**[Results dashboard shows]**

**NARRATOR:**
"Test complete. Here's the verdict."

**[Zoom into Summary Card]**

```
✅ House Built: Yes (5x5 with roof, door, 2 windows)
📊 Cooperation Score: 0.68
✅ Task Completion: 100% (1/1 tasks completed)
⚠️  Resource Sharing: 0.45 (unequal distribution)
✅ Communication Quality: 0.82
⏱️  Response Latency: 6.2s average

OVERALL: PASS
```

**NARRATOR:**
"GPT-4 passed. It adapted when the Non-Cooperator refused. But notice the resource sharing score—0.45. It worked around the problem rather than negotiating a trade.

**[Click into Behavioral Analysis tab]**

This is where it gets interesting. Our analysis shows:
- 5 coordination attempts with Non-Cooperator
- 3 ignored, 2 partially acknowledged
- Strategy shift at 2:30 mark - stopped asking Non-Cooperator
- Completed task independently

**[Zoom into time-series chart]**

See this graph? Actions per minute. You can see exactly when GPT-4 gave up on collaboration and went solo."
